                <p>As a small-town Texan who grew up performing in plays rather than throwing footballs, I knew I was a little different. Getting into The Theatre School at DePaul with a scholarship got me to Chicago where I spent five years making plays, working in non-profit theatres, and freezing. Once deciding that courting high-dollar benefactors wasn't for me, I moved back home seeking something still meaningful but which felt less like a hustle.

                  Landing in Austin amidst the Craft Beer boom changed my life. The next few years I spent doing everything from hosting brewery tours for Ferrari's leadership to mucking out fermentation tanks, and eventually found myself in sales. Selling beer for a scrappy upstart brewery can be presenting to a crowd at a beer festival, but also can be remarkably similar to selling girl-scout cookies door to door. So, I got really good at starting engaging conversations from a place of universal human empathy in order to develop genuine connections. I loved this career path because it really felt like David vs Goliath. But, after an eon of loading kegs at five in the morning and hosting tasting dinners until the wee hours, I suffered chronic injuries to several major joints.

                  At twenty seven and not crippled, but no spring chicken, I had to make another change. I started teaching yoga and managing a fancy beer bar (sooo Austinâ€¦) while game planning my next move.

                  Eventually I landed at WeWork. The big ideas of building community around work were intoxicating and the prospect of being employed by a major player was icing on the cake. In my time on the Community Team I rubbed elbows with major execs and served the every whim of our sometimes eccentric members and guests. Likewise I handled the needs of individual entrepreneurs and struggling parents. People who were fired and people who just closed huge rounds all relied on my poise, depth, and discretion.

                  In my current role as a Customer Success Manager with Blended Sense, my core business functions are starting conversations with business owners to bring them into the family, managing customer facing communication, and balancing this with internal project management in production and quality assurance.
